[CWE-284](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/284.html)

[CVSS 3.1 Score 7.5](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H&version=3.1)

## Description

Anonymous logins are allowed on the remote FTP server.

## Security Impact

The FTP server may contain sensitive files because anonymous FTP servers are often used to exchange files between different users. These files can be downloaded by anybody who visits this FTP server. Anonymous FTP is often used for "bounce attacks". Bounce attacks enable unauthorized users to scan networks, hosts, and ports behind a firewall. This can result in internal networks, VPN, and Intranets being compromised.

## Affected asset


## Remediation

Disable anonymous FTP if it is not required. Routinely check the FTP server to ensure that sensitive content is not being made available.
